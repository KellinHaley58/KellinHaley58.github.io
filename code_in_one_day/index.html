  <h1> Hi, my name is Cholula Haley-Moeljadi</h1>
  <p id="parastyle1"> The name is Chu - or Cholula - or Cholupa - people make a lot of names for me and my awesomeness. I am 5 year old Aussie Shepherd living my best life in Los Angeles!</p>

  <h2>In the Begginning...</h2>
  <p>I met my Mom when I was just a little nugget. I was 8 weeks old - and I didn't really know what to make of my world.</p>

  <h3> Some things that really scared me:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Everything</li>
    <li>Noise</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>People</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>But then my Mom and I would hang out every day and take me on really cool adventures.</h3>

    <p>I began to realize life is REALLY awesome. Mom showed me how cool frisbees are. And the beach. We love the beach.</p>

  <h3>I always thought it was My mom and I. Until it wasn't. I got Jealous.</h3>

    <p>A couple times she would bring home other moms... and they would hang and play for a little while. A month, a year, maybe a couple... but in they end, it still just always felt like 'Me and Mom'

  <h3> And then one day Mom brought home someone really different...someone special</h3>
    <p> This new Mom... her name was Brenna, but her energy was different than all the other moms I had met. She had an energy like another dog. She played with me like a really nice (not so rough) dog. She always wanted to play ball, and she even loved me more than Kellin. It was AWESOME. It STILL is awesome. I am finally the center of attention like a deserve.</p>

  <h3>Now, I have 2 moms... and we have a pretty awesome adventures as a family. We do things like: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Snuggle in bed. (Brenna finally convinced Kellin)</li>
      <li>Play</li>
      <li>Ski</li>
      <li>Spoil. Me. Rotten</li>

  <img src="images/chu_smile.jpg">
  <p>Needless to say, my life is pretty great these days and I am so grateful for both my Moms. I never thought Kellin would find someone who would love me more - but, I had my vote for that since she picked me up at 8 weeks!</p>
